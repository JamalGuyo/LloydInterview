# MovieApp

This project was developed using Angular, Bootstrap, OMDBapi

## Get Started

## HOW IT WORKS

The movie app has two pages. One for searching and the other for displaying results of the search.

## Search Page
The search page is inspired by the simplicity of the netflix landingpage

## Validation
The search input uses a simple validation to ensure that it is not empty. The search button is also disabled until the validation passes
